Known by their YouTube channel \\\"RackaRacka\\\" They were able to pull off a great low budget horror film on the budget of $4.5 million Australian dollars that feels at least 20 million.The cinematography and direction were all incredible with some expertly crafted scenes and a very dark and foreboding story that does have some originality to it despite being another supernatural, hell-demon, \\\"other side\\\" story. The scenes with the hand were legitimately scary and tense with a very unpredictable nature to it, the rest of the story was surprisingly unpredictable and unconventional, that also captures the modern Australian generation very well.The acting in this movie was off the charts and really delivered every emotion these characters were feeling at any given time and their reaction to exactly what was happening, internally and externally. The movie does depict Australian Gen Z\\u00e9rs pretty well, me being one of them. They did use it to their advantage in this movie, with RackaRacka being Gen Z as well, they were able to nail their modern Australian characters to perfection.The movie really did have an impactful effect on me, with me starting to feel a little ill by the end of the movie and me processing what all had just happened that I won't spoil in this review. Overall, the tone didn't just feel like shallow horror, but a legitimate one that actually has a foothold in Australian society that did feel somewhat believable in certain areas. The tension was soaring and ever present, the music was great too, there weren't many jump scares in this but the scary scenes themselves were clever and hard hitting.The movie didn't just fly by either, it did feel like it did run a bit longer than just 90 minutes and I did appreciate how it held my attention the way it did. I did feel genuine dread from it, that I haven't felt from a horror movie like this in a VERY long time. If not ever. The only problem I had with it is that I wished the story was a bit more revelatory and not so secretive in a lot of areas.Go see it if you're a fan of Horror and Modern Australian Cinema. I hope this brings nothing but success for The Philippou Brothers and the film has already gotten recognition by several popular horror directors including Jordan Peele.\",\n          \"This film is based off the memoir by David Sheff (played by Steve Carell) and Nic Sheff (played by Timothee Chalamet). It follows a father who is desperately trying to help to son and slowly coming to terms that maybe he can't. Let me tell you, this is some powerful stuff that is executed flawlessly by the actors. All were great but in particular Timothee and Steve are standouts. My bet is that the diner scene (\\\"This is who I am\\\") will be the clip chosen during awards season. But theres also some more subtle nuanced scenes too. In particular there is this scene right after Nic has relapsed by popping some pills and you can just tell he is thinking \\\"Why did I just do that?\\\". And your heart also breaks for David when you see him driving around looking for his son.The director does choose with this film to present in a non-linear way. Often times it does show flashbacks. That might not be everyone's cup of tea but I think it works. I think it helps to delve into David's mind and understand where he's coming from. He probably is thinking \\\"Where did I go wrong?\\\" I also felt the director did a good job of establishing shots to remind you of a happier time without using flashbacks. For instance there is a scene where Nic is playing with his younger siblings in the sprinkler and then later (after another heartbreaking scene of Nic fleeing) there is a shot of the empty backyard with the sprinkler coming on.The screenwriter was saying that he originally didnt want to do this film as he previously did a drug film (Candy -starring Heath Ledger) which was also based on his real life addiction with heroin. But ultimately decided to do this one as he never really had shown the other side of drug addiction. I thought he did a good job with it. It never glamourized doing drugs, but I also liked and appreciated that Nic was humanized in this. Yes, he is causing his family pain, but he isnt treated as the villain. You feel for him too.Overall, I quite liked this film. And I also thought the soundtrack was on point. I think you will see this film pop up during awards season. Maybe Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay, but I think definitely for Timothee and Steve. It would be criminal if they werent there. Another thing I want to note is that about halfway through the credits there is a voiceover done by Timothee where he is reading out a poem that is briefly mentioned earlier. So that might be something you want to stick around for.\",\n          \"Now here's a story that has something for us all, if you consider all the past events and things that went before, all the options, permutations, that could have ended in relations, outcomes, futures, roads untaken, that then fall. As Jung Hae Sung and Nora meet as kids, there's a connection but then adios she bids, moving to the USA, kimchi days are left astray, different plays shape different folks - the lives they've lived. Correspondence over time keeps thoughts reflective, then meeting up creates a kind of retrospective, what could have been, and what could be, things preordained, but choice is free, quite intriguing, but it rests on your perspective.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
